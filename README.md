This repository holds the source files for MyBB 2.0, the upcoming major version of MyBB. MyBB is the free and open source, intuitive, extensible, and incredibly powerful forum software you've been looking for.

MyBB 2.0 is not yet stable and should **not** be used on live boards in any situation. Support is not provided for 2.0 until it is officially released as a stable product and any issues regarding basic support will be closed immediately. If you are not an experienced developer or administrator, this repository is probably not aimed at you.
